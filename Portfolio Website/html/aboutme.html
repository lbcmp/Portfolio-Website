			<p>When I first started college, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I thought I would have it all figured out by the time it was required to declare a major. But still, nope, no idea. But I had to choose something, so I went ahead and declared mathematics as my major. It was the only subject that I ever truly enjoyed.</p>
			<p>Some time later, a professor of mine suggested that I take an introduction class for computer science, since they thought it would be a good fit for me. I was a bit skeptical but figured, why not? It was during that Introduction to Programming Methods I class- where I learned the basics of Java programming- that I finally found the passion I was looking for. At the end of the semester, I declared computer science as my second major and have not looked back since.</p>
			<p>I am interested in mobile app and full stack web development, but I am still a beginner in both. I have started to tinker with Android Studio and have made my first website with CSS and HTML. I am going to improve my skills by participating in the CUNY 2X Tech program this summer, taking an iOS class in the fall, and participating in the CUNY Tech Prep program. I am excited to learn a lot, grow my skill set, and meet other students that have the same passions as me.</p>
